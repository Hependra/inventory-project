I am developing a website project using Flask, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project includes a main page with animations, a login page, a signup page, a cart, and a checkout page. While it is still a work in progress and not fully integrated yet, I am uploading it as an open-source resource so that others who want to learn web development can explore and build upon it. My goal is to create a functional and visually appealing website while making it accessible for beginners to understand core web development concepts.

All you have to do is copy paste the entire code in a folder.
Open visual studio code. -> Go to File -> select open Folder -> Then select the folder iin which you have pasted all the code.

Go to terminal and type pip install -r requirements.txt
This command will install all the required library. If by chance, I missed any library use pip install libraryname.

last step
Go to the terminal and type python app.py.

If there is any issue regarding the code. Please reach out to me at hshappysingh793@gmail.com.
